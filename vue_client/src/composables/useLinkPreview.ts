// Client half of link previews.
//
// ⚠⚠ Resolution is driven by message INGEST, never by rendering. `primePreviews` is called
// when messages enter the store — a backlog frame, a history page, a live message — and
// components only ever READ, through `useLinkPreview`.
//
// The first version had this backwards: a row asked for its preview *while rendering*, which
// kicked off a fetch, which mutated shared state, which grew the row, which forced the list to
// correct its own scroll position. Rendering had side effects, so every scroll into history
// triggered async growth and needed bespoke compensation. QA felt it exactly as described:
// "the chat loads in completely flat, then inline content loads in a burst, throwing off the
// scroll offset".
//
// Slack and Discord don't have this problem because an unfurl is part of the message record —
// it arrives WITH the message, so scrollback is laid out correctly on first paint and async
// growth only happens for a brand-new message at the bottom, where the list already follows.
// Priming at ingest is how we get that property without the server storing unfurls on every
// message (which would mean fetching for people who have the feature off).
//
// Two layers of coalescing, catching different things:
//
//   - `cache` dedupes across TIME. Scroll past a link and back, and the second pass is free.
//   - `queue` dedupes across a TICK. A history page arrives with fifty rows; they become one
//     POST rather than fifty.

 * ⚠⚠ THIS PREDICATE FAILS OPEN, deliberately and in every branch. Its consumer withholds a whole
 * message's attachment block while it answers true, so every "not sure" it returns turns a
 * partial failure into a blank message — a strictly worse outcome than the layout shift the gate
 * exists to prevent. Only a request we are actively waiting on counts as pending.
 *
 *   - carries a value          → settled, whatever the value says
 *   - nobody ever primed it    → settled. The divergence case: a permanently-null ref must render
 *                                as nothing NOW rather than stall the message forever.
 *   - waiting on a re-ask      → SETTLED, and this is the branch that matters most. `retry` holds
 *                                two different states — a short-TTL `unavailable` (has a value)
 *                                and a URL put back in play by `forgetForRetry` after a transport
 *                                failure or an omitted answer (value still null). Counting the
 *                                second as pending hid the block for the entire 15s→5min backoff
 *                                ladder, and indefinitely while a server kept failing: one 502
 *                                during a deploy blanked the attachments of every message that
 *                                shared a batch with it, cached siblings included.
 *   - queued or in flight      → pending, bounded by RESOLVE_TIMEOUT_MS below.
