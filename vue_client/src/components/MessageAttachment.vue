  <!-- Direct media: no card, no chrome. A frame around an image is furniture around content. -->
  <!-- ⚠⚠ THE RESERVER IS THIS SPAN, ALWAYS — never the `<img>`, and never its width/height
       attributes. Those attributes were believed to reserve the box "BEFORE any bytes arrive";
       measured in both engines against a `src` that never resolves, they do not:

         Safari   pending 319x240   loaded 319x240
         Chrome   pending   0x0     loaded 319x240      (attrs 1841x1384)

       `.inline-image` sets `width: auto; height: auto` (below), which beats the attributes'
       presentational hints and leaves only the UA `aspect-ratio`. An `<img>` that has not loaded
       and carries `alt=""` "represents nothing" per HTML, and Blink honours that literally:
       no box at all. WebKit keeps one from the ratio, which is the whole of lurker#705 — every
       inline image in Chrome jumped 0 -> 240px at DECODE time, long after the atomic reveal's
       `previewRevision` re-pin had run, so a buffer opened at the tail landed 240px short of it.

       So the wrapper carries the geometry for every untiled image, derived from the server's
       dimensions rather than from bytes: `reserveStyle` resolves to exactly the box the loaded
       image occupies. In a mosaic the cell's fixed size governs and the wrapper stays out of the
       way — see `dim-passthrough`.

       ⚠ Geometry on the WRAPPER also keeps the empty letterbox out of the image: pinned on the
       `<img>`, a 16x16 favicon.ico became a 240px-tall, full-column-wide element carrying
       `role="button"` and a handler that calls `stopPropagation`, so a tap anywhere in the ~99%
       of it that is background opened the lightbox AND swallowed the row click — which on touch
       is the only thing that opens the message-actions sheet. A wrapper has no handlers, so those
       pixels keep belonging to the row. Same defect class as the `@click.stop` note below. -->

  <!-- MEDIA, not a link card: a clip or track whose poster we hold renders the way an image
       does — the frame inline, no chrome, a badge naming what it is — because a pasted media
       URL is content, not a citation. The reserve span carries the geometry exactly like the
       image branch above (the poster's dimensions ride thumbWidth/thumbHeight), so the box is
       byte-independent and the atomic reveal holds.
       ⚠ The poster is OUR OWN decode served from our own route (no origin fetch happens by
       rendering it), which is what lets it appear unasked without touching the media policy —
       the policy's line is bytes of the CLIP, and those still move only on a deliberate act.
       ⚠ Two interaction shapes, one look: with the viewer on, the poster is a button and the
       deliberate act is opening the overlay's native player (which fetches the ORIGIN
       directly); with it off, the poster is a plain link to the origin — because the body
       hides the URL text for inline-rendered media (MessageBody.rendersInline), this element
       is the only remaining path to the clip and MUST navigate somewhere. -->

  <!-- ⚠⚠ A FILE CARD, not a player, and the absence of a `src` is the whole point. An inline
       `<video>` fetches before anyone asks — `preload="metadata"` at minimum, and the `#t=`
       poster trick this replaces made it a range request for real frames — so the element
       itself was the involuntary fetch. The server no longer mints `src` for these kinds
       (`toDescriptor`), which also stops one clip being relayed per viewer, per view, forever:
       the byte cache stores images only, so video never got cheap on the second read. That
       relay exhausted the control plane's socket memory on 2026-08-10. Pressing the link is a
       deliberate act and goes straight to the origin, where a hidden IP was never buying the
       reader anything a click wouldn't reveal a second later.
       The operator-facing statement of this is in docs/SELF_HOSTING.md.
       ⚠ Only the TITLE is a link, not the whole card. A full-card anchor would swallow the row
       click, which on touch is the only thing that opens the message-actions sheet — the same
       defect the wrapper note above is written about.
       ⚠ No `measured` emit: unlike an image or a player this box has no bytes coming, so its
       height is final at first paint and there is no late growth for the scroller to chase. -->

       raised background so it reads as a distinct object rather than as more chat text.
       TWO shapes: a small square beside the text, or text on its own. ⚠ A landscape image under
       the text — Discord's large-embed form, and what this component briefly did — was built,
       run against real links and rejected on looking at it: the picture dominates the message
       rather than annotating it, and a 240px band per link turns a few pasted URLs into a page
       of somebody else's pictures. The square annotates, which is what a preview is for.
       ⚠ No site/author LINE. Discord doesn't have one and it was the least useful line on the
       card: the URL it names is already in the message, a word above it. The site name is still
       what the card falls back to when a page has no title — see `heading`. -->

         embed URL after a rate-limited provider call. With the heading gated on `title` those
         rendered as a tinted panel containing a picture and nothing else, or nothing at all: no
         text, no ANCHOR, and no accessible name, since the thumbnail is `alt=""`. A preview that

           the attribute falls through to the accessible DESCRIPTION and is announced twice. It
           also does nothing where the clamp actually bites — the narrow viewport this card has a

         this branch and the `v-else-if="preview.thumb"` one were false, so the card showed a

           one they asked for by pressing play. -->
      <!-- ⚠⚠ `origin`, NOT `no-referrer`, and this is the difference between a player and an
           error message. YouTube's embedded player validates the embedding page from the
           `Referer` header, and with none it refuses every video: **"Error 153 — Video player
           configuration error"**, for the whole life of this component. Proven by A/B rather
           than reasoned about — two iframes, same embed URL, same `allow`, differing only in
           this attribute: `no-referrer` fails and `origin` plays.
           ⚠ It is a REAL trade, not a free one, and an earlier version of this comment claimed
           otherwise ("the embed request tells them anyway"). It does not: an iframe `src` load
           is a navigation, so no `Origin` header is appended, and under `no-referrer` the
           provider genuinely could not identify the embedding host. After this it learns
           `scheme://host` — which for a self-hosted instance can itself be identifying. What is
           bought is the feature existing at all, and what is NOT given up is the path: never
           which channel, which buffer, or which message.
           ⚠ `origin` rather than `strict-origin` because `origin` is the value the A/B actually
           measured. An earlier version of this comment justified the choice by claiming they
           differ on an http page, with `strict-origin` sending nothing — that is backwards.
           Referrer Policy suppresses only on a DOWNGRADE (secure → insecure), and both
           EMBED_ORIGINS are https, so an http LAN page framing them is an upgrade and the two
           values are byte-identical in every configuration reachable today. `strict-origin` is
           the safer default the moment a non-https embed origin is ever added; it is not adopted
           here on the strength of a spec reading, because a spec reading is what produced the
           sentence this one replaces.
           The privacy property doing the real work is the facade above: nothing at all is
           requested from the video host until the reader asks for it. -->

 * a paywalled article that ships a description and no heading, and the deliberately-degraded
 * video record that survives a rate-limited provider call with nothing but an embed URL. Each of
 * those rendered as a panel with no anchor in it at all: a preview that goes nowhere, looks
 * finished, and (with an `alt=""` thumbnail) presents to a screen reader as an empty div.
 *
 * `siteName` is the fallback because the SERVER already guarantees it — `pageRecord` clamps
 * `providerName || og:site_name || url.hostname`, so it is non-null for every ok card, and that
 * hostname fallback exists precisely to be the thing a card can always show. The URL is parsed
 * here as a third rung anyway: a descriptor is a wire value, and a client that depends on a
 * server invariant should be able to survive its absence rather than render blank.
 *
 * ⚠ This is NOT the site line coming back. There is no separate row for it — when a page has a
 * title, that is the whole heading and the hostname appears nowhere.
 *
 * ⚠ `hostname`, NOT `host`, and the difference is the PORT. This rung is a backstop for the
 * server's own last resort, so it has to produce the same string the server would: `pageRecord`
 * clamps `url.hostname`, and `host` appends `:8096` to it. Otherwise one card is named
 * `nas.local` or `nas.local:8096` depending on which rung happened to fire — two spellings of one

 * survivable — the logo is small and centred rather than cropped into a band.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ `twitter:card` is NOT consulted, and it is the obvious thing to reach for. It is the
 * author's stated INTENT and it disagrees with the author's own picture in exactly the direction
 * that produces the bad result: Ars Technica declares `summary_large_image` beside that 512x512
 * logo. Re-verified against live markup while writing this. Declared dimensions can be wrong too,
 * but they are wrong about the thing they describe rather than about something else.
 *
 * ⚠ Reading `naturalWidth` on load would be accurate and is the one thing this component may not
 * do: the layout would then depend on bytes and every card would re-arrange on decode, which is
 * R1, the rule the rest of this file exists to keep.

 * ⚠⚠ THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO `@error` HANDLING, and that is a decision rather than an omission.
 *
 * A version of this component tracked a `failed` flag to paint a panel fill instead of the UA's
 * broken-image glyph. Measured in three engines, it made things worse rather than better:
 *
 *   - Setting a non-empty `alt` on failure re-triggers frame construction in Gecko and DROPS the
 *     attribute-derived aspect ratio, collapsing a measured 240px box to an 18px text line —
 *     222px of uncompensated shrink that plain `alt=""` does not suffer. (⚠ That measurement was
 *     taken when the `<img>` was the reserver. It no longer is — the wrapper holds the box and an
 *     `alt` swap cannot reach it — so this particular collapse is now structurally impossible.
 *     Kept as the record of why the flag was tried, not as a live constraint.)
 *   - The reset that was supposed to clear the flag could never fire: `mintProxyToken` is an HMAC
 *     over the URL, so a re-delivered answer carries a byte-identical `src` and the watch on it
 *     never runs. And an `ok` preview is never re-asked at all, so the flag was permanent — a
 *     two-second network blip greyed out every inline image for the life of the row.
 *   - Dropping `role`/`tabindex` on failure removed them from an element that may currently HOLD
 *     focus, dumping a keyboard user back to `<body>` mid-mosaic.
 *
 * The byte-independence rule this file serves is already satisfied without any of it, and since
 * lurker#705 it is satisfied MORE strongly than this paragraph used to claim: the reservation does
 * not depend on the image element at all — `.dim-reserve` holds the box for every untiled image,
 * from the descriptor, whether the bytes arrive or not. (The old claim, that "the width/height
 * attributes survive a failed load", was doubly wrong: those attributes reserve nothing once author
 * CSS sets `width: auto`, so what survived a failed load was nothing at all in Blink.)
 * A broken-image glyph in a correctly-sized box is a smaller problem than every one of the above.

/* ⚠⚠ `width: 100%` is scoped to the column, and the scoping is the guard. Unscoped, this rule
   arms the sizing that DELETES the card's text: in a row, a basis of the whole content box beside
   `.card-text`'s basis of 0% leaves the text at 0px wide, hidden behind its own `overflow`. What
   disarmed it was a class binding, so every CSS-side way of losing the column — renaming
   `.card-video`, dropping its `flex-direction`, a later media query, a future non-video card
   wanting this box — kept the suite green while the title vanished. happy-dom applies no
   stylesheet, so no test can ever observe that; expressing the dependency in the selector is what
