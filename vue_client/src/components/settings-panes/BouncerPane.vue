  How to attach an IRC client to this instance's bouncer. The category only
  exists where the instance runs one (features.bouncer), so this pane never has
  to explain a bouncer nobody has.

      Clients that support <code>soju.im/bouncer-networks</code> — Goguma, gamja, Halloy, SeraphIRC
      and more — take every network at once: sign in as <code>{{ username }}</code> with your
      password, and pick the network in the client.
    </p>
    <p class="muted small">
      Any other client attaches to one network at a time: sign in as
      <code>{{ username }}/{{ exampleNetwork }}</code
      >, with the network’s name as it appears in
      <RouterLink to="/settings/networks">Networks</RouterLink>.
    </p>

      For the password, a

        >read-write API token</RouterLink
      >
      beats your account password: IRC clients store it in plain text, and a token can be revoked on
      its own.
