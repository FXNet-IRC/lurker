// Consolidation of join/part/quit/nick/chghost "noise" events into a per-identity
// net effect, IRCCloud-style, plus op/voice churn folded alongside it. Pure,
// side-effect-free, no DOM/Vue deps — safe to import from the Vue renderer, the
// Node demo script, and tests.
//
// Algorithm:
//   1. Walk a stream of message rows; group consecutive foldable events into a
//      "run". Any other row (a real message, a kick, a topic, a divider)
//      terminates it. A `mode` row folds when it is pure member-status churn
//      and terminates the run otherwise — one ban or channel flag in the
//      message and it stands alone (see foldsIntoRun / isChurnMode). Before
//      that, EVERY mode row broke the run, which is why a netsplit rejoin on an
//      auto-op channel came out as summary, mode, summary, mode, summary.
//   2. Inside a run, walk per nick and accumulate an action sequence:
//        'J' = join
//        'L' = leave (part or quit)
//        'R' = rename (this identity changed nick)
//        'H' = rehost (chghost; ident and/or host changed)
//      Renames transfer the identity to the new key so we follow the chain.
//   3. Classify by the first/last J|L action:
//        first=L, last=J → reconnected     (was present; left and came back)
//        first=L, last=L → left            (was present; net result: gone)
//        first=J, last=J → joined          (was absent; net result: present)
//        first=J, last=L → joinedAndLeft   (was absent; net result: gone)
//      Identities with no J|L action fall back to rename over rehost:
//      any 'R' → renamed, else 'H' only → rehosted.
//
//      'H' is deliberately transparent to the J|L scan (#593). Post-netsplit
//      each rejoining user emits JOIN then CHGHOST as they identify, so their
//      sequence is [J, H]; that must read as a plain "joined" rather than
//      splitting the summary into "N joined" plus "N changed host". The
//      host change only earns its own category when nothing else happened.
//   4. Mode rows are folded by a SECOND pass, keyed on (nick, letter) rather
//      than on identity, since a mode change has no join/leave sequence and its
//      target need never have joined inside the run. The run's last change to a
//      pair wins and nothing is dropped — see modeGroups.
//   5. A run of exactly one event is passed through unchanged (so a lone
//      "Alice joined" still renders with the familiar --> styling, and a lone
//      "+o alice" still renders as its narrated mode line).

 * opped" — the mode-side of `joinedAndLeft`, and the same vocabulary the
 * presence half already uses for the same shape. Nothing is ever dropped: the
 * summary row has no expand affordance, so a nick dropped here would be
 * information deleted with no way to get it back.
 *
 * Renames are NOT followed. The identity walk migrates a nick across an 'R'

 * reported as bob. Threading two identity models through one run costs more
