/**
 * The four IRC channel prefixes (RFC 2811 §2.1): `#` global, `&` server-local,
 * `+` no-modes, `!` safe/timestamped.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ Testing only for `#` is the single most-repeated bug in this codebase — it had accumulated
 * in ~30 places in the web client alone (#724), where an `&`/`+`/`!` channel was then treated as
 * a DM: no nicklist, a `probe-presence` fired at the channel name as if it were a nick, nick
 * colouring, whois menu items, and sorting among the DMs. It survived because `&` is server-local
 * and `+`/`!` are historic, so almost every real network only uses `#`.
 *
 * Shared rather than per-tier precisely because the halves disagreeing is what caused the damage:
 * the server has classified all four since `kindForTarget` was written, so every client-side `#`
 * test was a place the two tiers silently parted company.
 *
 * ⚠ This answers "is this the name of a CHANNEL". It is NOT the question a completion trigger
 * asks — that one is "did the user type a `#`", where the character is a literal sigil and
 * widening it would pop a channel picker on any `+` in ordinary prose. Those sites stay `#`-only
 * and say so.

 * The DCC CHAT buffer sigil. `=alice` is a direct peer-to-peer conversation with alice carried
 * on a TCP socket THIS PROCESS owns — it is not a channel, not a nick, and **never an IRC
 * target**. The convention is irssi's (dcc-chat.c:179, fe-dcc-chat.c:58) and repartee's
 * (app/dcc.rs:121); both also route `/msg =nick` to the socket, so it carries addressing
 * meaning rather than being a display label.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ Lives here, next to `isChannelTarget`, for the reason that comment already gives: the
 * damage comes from the two tiers disagreeing about a target's shape. `=` is the THIRD answer
 * to "what is this target", after channel and DM, and every site that used to treat
 * "not a channel" as "therefore a nick I can put on the wire" is now wrong.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ A `=` target reaching the IRC socket is the failure mode to guard against — as `PRIVMSG
 * =alice`, `MONITOR + =alice` or `TAGMSG =alice`. The structural defence is that these buffers
 * are minted `kind: 'dcc'` (server/db/buffers.ts), which keeps them out of the kind-keyed SQL
 * that feeds presence tracking and bouncer playback; the guards in ircManager's send paths are
 * the second line, covering the composer, MCP and attached bouncer clients alike.
