// Name → buffer_id resolution, in one place.
//
// A buffer's identity is buffers.id; its name is an attribute resolved through
// here. Resolution is deliberately UNCACHED: it is one idx_buffers_key point
// seek — the same cost the hot paths already pay for getState — and a name→id
// cache would be a second place storing the name, which is the exact bug class
// the normalization exists to kill. If profiling ever demands one, its
// invalidation belongs to renameBuffer/deleteBuffer alone.
//
// Folding happens on the way in, through `foldTargetFor` (buffers.ts) — the
// network's declared ISUPPORT CASEMAPPING since #707, legacy Unicode-lowercase
// until a network declares one. Getting the fold wrong through this seam fails
// to FIND a buffer — visible and recoverable — rather than splitting one,
// which is the property that made deferring #707 safe while the seam waited.

 * (ensureExists: creates OPEN, never reopens a closed row) — moved from a
 * moment after the insert to the insert itself, because the id-keyed table
 * cannot represent "row exists, buffer doesn't" the way name-keyed reads
 * tolerated. The distinction that matters is preserved exactly: a target with
 * an existing CLOSED row resolves to it without touching its state, so the
 * filter's reopen gate (which events outrank a user's closed flag) still
 * decides whether the buffer resurfaces.
 *
 * Sentinels route to their open mint; a stray ':'-prefixed non-sentinel
 * target (an imported ':server:<foreignId>' string) is minted 'server'-kinded
 * so kindForTarget's channel/dm split never claims it.
